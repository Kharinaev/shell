# shell
## Simulation of Shell command line for linux

My project from 3-rd semester of CMC MSU

  You can 
- enter any command, that bash has, like ls, cd, pwd, cat etc.,
- make command in backgroung mode using & (sleep 100 &),
- change input and output with files using <,>,>> (cat text1.txt > text.txt),
- make conveyor of programs using | (./program1 | program2 | program3, so program1 output will be input for program2 etc.)
- and combine this possibilities.

Program will make any your command until EOF (ctrl + C)
